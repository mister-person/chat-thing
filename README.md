# Chat Thing

It's a chat app, but you can see people's keystrokes as they're typing. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Builds the app in release mode and starts it.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Only serves static content. For it to actually work you also need to run the release mode server on port 3001.

### `npm run startServer [port]`

Builds only the server and starts it on the specified port.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See package.json for more.
